	<p>The new eldenring DLC "Shadow Of The Erdtree" has been announced. The release date is unknown but we have an image which shows someone on a horse in a field going towards what appears to be a tree. This tree is important because the main game of eldenring is the main focus of the game. This tree could either be the Erdtree in a growing state or it could be a completly different tree. Some people speculate the tree is being wrapped around by a different tree since it kind of looks like thats whats happening in the image. The person on the horse is speculated to be Miqualla because of the wrap around crown they have on. The horse is named torrent, which is the horse the player uses in the game to travel around. People think Miqualla could be the original owner of torrent because the player is told in game that they arent the first one to ride torrent.</p>
